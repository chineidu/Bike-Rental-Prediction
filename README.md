# Bike-Rental-Prediction
This project optimizes a city-wide bike-sharing platform's dynamic pricing. It uses a machine learning model to forecast hourly bike rental demand and a real-time algorithm to adjust prices. The goal is to maximize revenue during peak times and stimulate demand during slow periods.
